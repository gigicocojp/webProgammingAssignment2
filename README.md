# webProgammingAssignment2

this is a project that intergrates the front and back end by using several promgramming techniques. Php, html, css and javascript are used to demostrate a table in the front end.   
And in the back end, php is used to write footballplayerDao file and baseDao to accomplish CRUD operations and connect the mysql database. In order to make this program friendly to the new programmer, Xampp software should be installed to make the apache server deployment much easier.
